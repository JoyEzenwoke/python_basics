As part of my 10months software Engineering [SE] course,i have embarked in learning python to enhanced my programming skill and develop practical applications .
My primary goal is to effectively manage my time to ensure i grasp the fundamental ,consistently practice and ultimately create meaningful projects using python.
This structured approach will help me build a strong foundation and make the most of my learning journey.
